# RoboRally by team R.T.I.T.N.E.404.T.N.N.F
This is a student project in the class INF 112 where we are set to make a digital version of the boardgame RoboRally.
To do this we are using libgdx and Tilded.

## Build and run

Follow these steps to run the game.

1. Clone the reposetory: ```git clone https://github.com/inf112-v21/Runtime-Terror-Import-Team_Name-Error-404-Team-Name-Not-Found.git```
2. Open the project in InteliJ or simmilar program.
3. Run the program from the main methode in the Main class using the playbutton in the top right or to the left of the methode.

## How to play
To play the game you press the "play" button on the title screen that comes up after you have builded the game.

You move around by using the arrow keys or A,W,S,D keys

The goal is at this moment in development to get to any flag to win, but be careful if you set on a hole you die.
